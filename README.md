# HailToTheOrange
This is our submission to the WECE Hacks 2023. 

Start by viewing our Inspiration photos generated with AI as we ideated. 

The inspiration for Zesty Pesty product came from how we always had scraps of orange whenever we ate oranges and didn't want to throw them away because they smell amazing. We decided to make it into a diffuser because it would use the entire orange and fill our rooms with a pleasing aroma.

We made an oil diffuser that uses scraps, like orange peels or herbs. It reuses what would be waste and turns it into something that can be enjoyed for prolonged periods.

View our View1 and View2 photos for the final product design. We incorporated an electrical compoent controlled by the servomotor_code and the circuit scematic all in our Git. If you want to see more in detailed of the CAD, there is a design drawing from Fusion 360 with the bottom, side views and a section view (ref. Hail to the Oragen Drawing v2.pdf). The drawing has a more detailed view of the grinder, electrical components and hosuing, driveshaft, healical gears and top flipcap. 

Using the Zesty Pesty will start by the user having additional orange peels, using the tab to flip up the top cap and inserting the orange peels. They will turn the knkob at the bottom indiating the time duration they want the diffuser to run. Then, their orange peels will be ground in the healical gears and falll with gravity into the water below. The ultrasoinic vibrator will vibrate and create a mist infused with the orange's oils and disperse from the top. Water can later be refilled but sliding the bottom housing offand pouring more water inside. The electricla compeonents of the Zesty Pesty are stored below the water basin. 

We incorporated accessibility into our product by installing a digital water sensor with an LED and speaker connected to it for an auditory and visual output. The Zesty Pesty will light up and make a sound indicating the water level is too low or high when refilling the water basin at the bottom. The knob connected to a potientiometer and the know was made with rigids to make easier to grab and rotate.    

We reserached how coffee grinders, herb grinders and current aromatherapy products operated an implemented some of the processes into our product. Diffusers work by ultrasonically vibrating water with an essential oil. This vibration creates ultrasonic waves and disperses the water into the air. 

We aim to create another use of a food waster product- orange peels or other citrus fuit, tea leaves, and herbs. 

Also, note Hail to the Orange is a slogan used by the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign athletics becuse ornage and blue are the school colors.
