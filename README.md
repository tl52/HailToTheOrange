# HailToTheOrange
This is our submission to the WECE Hacks 2023.
Start by viewing our Inspiration photos generated with AI as we ideated.

The inspiration for Zesty Pesty product came from how we always had scraps of orange whenever we ate oranges and didn't want to throw them away because they smell amazing. We decided to make it into a diffuser because it would use the entire orange and fill our rooms with a pleasing aroma.

We made an oil diffuser that uses scraps, like orange peels or herbs. It reuses what would be wasted and turns it into something that can be enjoyed for prolonged periods. We researched how coffee grinders, herb grinders, and current aromatherapy products operated and implemented some of the processes into our product. Diffusers work by ultrasonically vibrating water with an essential oil. This vibration creates ultrasonic waves and disperses the water into the air.

View our View1 and View2 photos for the final product design. We incorporated an electrical component controlled by the servomotor code and the circuit schematic all in our Git. If you want to see more in detail of the CAD, there is a design drawing from Fusion 360 with the bottom, side views and a section view (ref. Hail to the Orange Drawing v2.pdf). The drawing has a more detailed view of the grinder, electrical components and housing, driveshaft, helical gears, and top flip cap.

The circuit schematic uses an Arduino 

Using the Zesty Pesty will start by the user having additional orange peels, using the tab to flip up the top cap and inserting the orange peels. They will turn the knob at the bottom indicating the time duration they want the diffuser to run. Then, their orange peels will be ground in the helical gears and fall with gravity into the water below. The ultrasonic vibrator will vibrate and create a mist infused with orange oils and disperse from the top. Water can later be refilled but sliding the bottom housing off and pouring more water inside. The electrical components of the Zesty Pesty are stored below the water basin.

We incorporated accessibility into our product by installing a digital water sensor with an LED and speaker connected to it for an auditory and visual output. The Zesty Pesty will light up and make a sound indicating the water level is too low or high when refilling the water basin at the bottom. The knob connected to a potentiometer and the knob was made with rigids to make easier to grab and rotate.

We aim to create another use of a food waste product orange peels or other citrus fruit, tea leaves, and herbs.

Also, note Hail to the Orange is a slogan used by the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign athletics because orange and blue are the school colors.
